# Gesture_based_robotic_arm_artix_7
The project basically is about making ge and the the fpga will  sture based robotic arm  using the artix 7 fpga . We will use a camera module as input and the fpga will process it and display  it in monitor first then after verifying the algorithm we will check with our  4 axis robotic arm .
